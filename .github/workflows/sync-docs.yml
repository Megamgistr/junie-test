            Review pr diff and update documentation to match code changes.

            **Check for outdated docs:**
            - README.md examples using changed APIs
            - API documentation (JSDoc, docstrings, OpenAPI)
            - Configuration examples (if config changed)
            - Migration guides (for breaking changes)

            **Update only if needed:**
            - Keep examples simple and runnable
            - Show before/after for breaking changes
            - Add "Added in vX.X" for new features
            - Only modify documentation files (README.md, docs/**)
            - If nothing to update, don't make changes
            
            Procedure:
            Use gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }} to get a diff of the PR.
